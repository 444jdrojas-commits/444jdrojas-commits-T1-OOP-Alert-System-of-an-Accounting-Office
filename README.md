We are "Team Neon cursed" and We are going to do a Statement Assist System for small business.

Team #4 Statement Assist System

Our project will help our customer to improve document management and compliance within the accounting office. Currently, employees handle multiple client files and deadlines manually, which often leads to confusion, delays, and missed submissions. The absence of an automated notification system makes it difficult to maintain order and efficiency. Our project aims to solve this issue by developing a system that automatically alerts employees of upcoming deadlines, ensuring timely submissions, reducing human error, and improving overall workflow organization.
